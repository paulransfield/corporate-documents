If the Board has not fully performed its review upon the expiration of the thirty (30) days, the sale may be completed at that time. The results of the due diligence review shall be entered into the official records of the company. Following the review by the Board, if the Board, in its sole and exclusive discretion, determines that the individual or organization purchasing the shares does meet the minimum requirements established by the Board, the Board shall have the right to treat the transfered Shares as non-interested shares and restructure the transfered shares as shares of the Non-Voting Class.]]]
